I'm an aspiring computer scientist from Calgary, Alberta. My technical interests pertain to the use of machine learning to master tricky concepts and to solve real-world issues.

In my free time I enjoy long-distance running, weight training, and playing the piano or trumpet.

I currently attend the University of British Columbia, and am pursuing a combined degree in Computer Science and Mathematics.
