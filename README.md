I'm a second year student at the University of British Columbia, studying Computer Science and Mathematics. My main interests relate to using machine learning to extrapolate conclusions from data, and apply such knowledge to solve real-world issues. 

A few of the projects I'm working on at the moment include an [AI-based Rubik's Cube solver](https://github.com/azychen/rubiks-cube-solver "rubiks-cube-solver") and an [issue tracker](https://github.com/azychen/issue-tracker "issue-tracker"). In the past, I've worked on a [two-dimensional virtual physics sandbox](https://github.com/azychen/virtual-ball-pit "virtual-ball-pit").
